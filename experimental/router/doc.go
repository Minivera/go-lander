// Package router is an experimental package that adds the ability to route inside the application
// using the history API. This router is inspired by React-router 4 and works in very similar ways.
// The route information is stored in the context and provided to routing components. It is necessary
// to create a global router to use the routing components and logic, it should be created in a central
// location and reused throughout the lifecycle of the app.
//
// This package is even more unstable than the library itself, use at your own risk.
